    "content": "Data Description Understanding the variables The data can be decomposed into two parts: the income measure and the summary statistic. All variables have the following naming convention: INCOME MEASURE _ SUMMARY STATISTIC For example, inc1_gini is the gini coeffcient of primary income (inc1). We also add the prefix hhaa if the summary statistic is restricted to working age households. Summary statistics Variable name Concept Stata code mean Mean sum VARIABLE [w=hwgt*nhhmem] gini Gini coefficient sgini VARIABLE [aw=hwgt*nhhmem] conc Concentration index sgini VARIABLE [aw=hwgt*nhhmem], sortvar(SORTVARIABLE) kakwani Kakwani index VARIABLE_conc_SORTVARIABLE - SORTVARIABLE_gini All statistics are calculated at the individual level. We first calculate the measures at the household level (using the square root equivalence scale) but then we weight the summary statistics by the number of household members to provide an individual level summary statistic. This approach assumes the household resources are shared equally among the household members. Income measures Variable name Concept Definition inc1 Primary income Income from labor and capital inc2 Market income Primary income + pensions inc3 Gross income Market income + cash social transfers (other than pensions) inc4 Disposable income Gross income - income taxation and social security contribution (employer and employee) dhi Disposable income The survey measure available in the LIS database. Other measures In addition to income, we also calculate summary statistics of the following concepts: Variable name Concept LIS variables tax Taxes hxit + hsscer transfer Transfers hits - pubpension allpension Pensions pension - hitsap pubpension Public pensions hitsil + hitsup pripension Private pensions hicvip hxits Employee social security contributions (LIS and imputed) hxits=hsscee if hxits==. hsscee Employee social security contributions (imputed)   hsscer Employer social security contributions (imputed)   hssc Social security contributions (imputed)   Working-age subsample We calculate our summary statistics on the full sample of respondents for each national survey and we categorize pensions as part of income. Researchers may prefer to exclude pensioners and focus only on working-age households. We have also calculated our summary statistics for the subsample of working-age households. We define working-age households as those whose household head is between 25 and 60 years of age at the survey date Details on the summary statistics In progress Weighted mean We estimate the population mean of a variable by weighting the sample mean with weights provided in each household survey. The weights are calculated to match the sample with the population. Gini coefficient The Gini coefficient is a standardized measure of inequality which ranges from 0 to 1. Perfect equality has Gini coefficient of 0 and the most extreme level of inequality (where one person has everything and everyone else has nothing) has a Gini coefficient of 1. Concentration index The concentration index summarizes the distribution of a variable over households, ranked by household income. The index ranges from -1 to 1. Kakwani index The Kakwani index is the difference between the concentration index and the Gini index. The Kakwani index corrects the concentration index for the initial level of inequality.",

    "content": "Data on Taxes and Transfers We calculated tax, transfer and inequality measures for 22 countries using the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) database. Most importantly, we imputed employer social security contributions to provide a more accurate measure of taxes. The data is available for your use.

Four levers of redistribution: The impact of tax and transfer systems on inequality reduction. Review of Income and Wealth. Sources Our data is extracted from nationally representative household surveys, harmonized by the Luxembourg Income Study. We used the OECD’s Taxing Wages series to record tax rates for the imputations of social security contributions. You may view our code in this Github repo. Team This data is part of research project on tax and transfer systems by Elvire Guillaud, Matthew Olckers and Michaël Zemmour. Elvire and Michaël have a research agenda focusing on redistribution, which includes this project and several others. Victor Amoureux contributed extensively to the code.
